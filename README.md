# Rework of the revamp-it.ch website

_This is currently a proof-of-concept / demo / work-in-progress project._

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a way to built a dynamic website with few external dependencies.

For a simple company, organization or personal website it is often _not_ necessary to use a frontend framework and
create a single page application. A simple server side rendered website can be sufficient and easier to maintain.

However, a completely static website or a statically built website from source files (e.g. markdown) may not satisfy
requirements to easily update and manage content.

Therefore we choose a mixed approach where most of the site is built from static templates but specific areas (e.g. a blog)
are dynamic and get their content from a database.

To manage the content comfortably we created a simple content management system (CMS) that allows to edit and create content.
The CMS was split into a separate server in the cms/ directory.

The project is written in TypeScript with templates currently written in JavaScript. Express is used as web server framework
and sqlite as database. For styling Tailwind CSS is used.

NOTE/TODO: I think it would be good to convert the templates to TypeScript as well.

The look of the site is originally based off of: https://github.com/g-but/revampit

## Development / Demo setup

The easiest way to run the project is to use deno. Make sure deno is installed on your system. NPM is also required to install
the dependencies for the website and CMS.

### Setup example database

    mkdir ./db

    cd ./cms
    npm i
    deno run --allow-all ./setup-example-database.js

### CMS

Install and run the CMS:

    cd ./cms    # if not already done above
    npm i       # if not already done above
    npm run dev

The server should be running at http://localhost:3003 and show a login screen.

The example user and password are 'admin' and '1234'. This can be changed in the setup-example-database.js script.

NOTE/TODO: Currently the users and passwords cannot yet be managed within the CMS. Ideally unsafe default passwords
should never be used but instead a password should be set when executing the setup database script or at 1st login.
As this is only a demo it is currently left as it is.

### Main website

Install and run the main website:

    cd ./website    # from the base directory
    npm i
    npm run dev

### Tailwind CSS

To rebuild the CSS after changes run the following command in the `./website` and/or `./cms` directories:

    npm run devtw
